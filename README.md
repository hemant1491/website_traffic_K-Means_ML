# 🚀 Website Traffic Clustering Project

## 📝 Overview

This project performs an unsupervised machine learning analysis on website traffic data using **K-Means Clustering**. The primary goal is to identify patterns or clusters in the relationship between **Search Volume** and **Traffic Cost**.

The project is implemented using **Python**, with the analysis conducted in a **Jupyter Notebook**.

## 📌 Introduction

This notebook focuses on analyzing website traffic data to understand the relationship between:

* **🔎 Search Volume**: The number of times a keyword is searched.
* **💰 Traffic Cost**: The estimated cost of generating traffic for the keyword.

The aim is to group the data into clusters based on these two features.

---

## 📥 Data Loading & Exploration

* The dataset (`website_traffic_data.csv`) is loaded using **Pandas**.
* Basic exploratory data analysis (`head()`, `info()`, `describe()`) is performed to understand the structure and summary statistics of the data.

---

## 📊 Data Visualization

* A **scatter plot** is created using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to visualize the relationship between **Search Volume** and **Traffic Cost**.
* This helps in visually inspecting possible natural clusters.

---

## 🔍 K-Means Clustering

* The two key features (**Search Volume** and **Traffic Cost**) are selected and converted into a 2D array for clustering.
* **K-Means clustering** from **scikit-learn** is applied to group the data.

---

## 📈 Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters

* The **Elbow Method** is used to find the optimal number of clusters by plotting clustering inertia scores for cluster counts from 1 to 10.
* The "elbow point" suggests that **2 clusters** is a good choice.

---

## 🎨 Cluster Visualization

* K-Means clustering is run with **2 clusters**.
* Cluster labels are added to the dataset.
* A scatter plot is created to visualize the clusters:

  * **Cluster 0**: 🔵 Blue
  * **Cluster 1**: 🟢 Green
  * **Cluster Centroids**: ⭐ Red stars

---

## ✅ Conclusion

* The clustering reveals distinct groupings in the data based on **Search Volume** and **Traffic Cost**.
* Visualizations help in understanding the separation and central points of the clusters.
